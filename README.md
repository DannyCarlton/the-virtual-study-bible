# The Virtual Study Bible Wordpress Plugin

The purpose of this project is to provide a full Study Bible as a plugin for a Wordpress site. While there exists plenty of Bible plugins, the vast majority pull the content from outside sources. This plugin will instead allow the site owner to install all the data necessary to their own site. 

While I am a coder, I am also a designer, and my goal, with all my sites, has been to provide a design that is conducive to the function of the site itself. I've always strived, therefore to make all my Bible sites as visually pleasing as I can, studying the designs of as many popular Bible publishers as I can. From should follow function, but too many Bible sites have abandoned form altogether.
